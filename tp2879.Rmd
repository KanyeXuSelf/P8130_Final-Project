### Import and Clean the Data
```{r}
writing = read.csv(file = "./data/Project_1_data.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() 

head(writing)
```

*replace blanks with NA
* get rid of NA in specific plots

### Descriptive Statistics
```{r}
summary(writing$writing_score)

var(writing$writing_score)
sd(writing$writing_score)
```


### Percentiles
```{r}
percentiles = quantile(writing$writing_score, probs = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1))

print(percentiles)
```


### Visualizations
```{r}
ggplot(writing, aes(x = writing_score)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Writing Scores",
    x = "Score",
    y = "Frequency")
```

```{r}
ggplot(writing, aes(x = writing_score)) +
  geom_density(fill = "purple", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Density Plot of Writing Scores",
    x = "Writing Score",
    y = "Density")
```

```{r}
ggplot(writing, aes(x = gender, y = writing_score)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Writing Scores by Gender",
    x = "Gender",
    y = "Writing Score")
```

### Statistical Testing
```{r}
t_test = t.test(writing_score ~ gender, data = writing)

print(t_test)
```
